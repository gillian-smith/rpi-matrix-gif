# Animated GIFs on Adafruit RGB LED Matrix with Raspberry Pi

This tutorial explains how to display an animated gif on an Adafruit RGB LED Matrix panel using a Raspberry Pi microcontroller. 

I used my matrix to display a spooky ghost gif for Halloween. :jack_o_lantern:

  Connects your Raspberry Pi to the internet via wifi.
  * If you are using a Raspberry Pi that includes built-in wifi (ex: Raspberry Pi 3), you do need to purchase a wifi module.
  * Alternatively, you can use an Ethernet cable for a wired network connection. 


### Power
* [5V 4A (4000mA) switching power supply - UL Listed](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1466)
  
  <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1466"><img height="150" src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1466-02.jpg"></a>
  
  Powers the RGB Matrix HAT.

* [Female DC Power adapter - 2.1mm jack to screw terminal block](https://www.adafruit.com/products/368)
  
  <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/368"><img height="150" src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/368-03.jpg"></a>

  Connects the HAT to the power supply.

### Tools
* USB SD card reader
* Soldering iron and solder
* Wire cutters

### Other
* Micro USB cable
  
  Powers the Raspberry Pi using your regular computerâ€™s USB port or a USB wall charger.

* USB mouse and keyboard 
* HDMI display and cable


Youâ€™ll need these last two items to interface with your Raspberry Pi the first time you log in. Later, you can set up SSH to access your Raspberry Pi remotely.

## SOFTWARE
* [Aesprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)
  
  Animated sprite editor & pixel art tool. (Or some other program for creating 32x32 animated gif.)

* Nano
  
  A simple command line editor that omes pre-installed on Raspberry Pi OS. (Or some other code editor, such as VS Code.)

## INSTRUCTIONS

### Prepare your Raspberry Pi

<ol>
  <li>
    Follow Adafruitâ€™s instructions for getting Raspberry Pi OS running on your Raspberry Pi.
    I used the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a> to install Raspberry Pi OS on a microSD card. 
    Insert the prepared microSD card into the Raspberry Pi and boot it up!
  </li>
  <li>
		<a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-3-network-setup/overview">Connect your Raspberry Pi to the Internet.</a>
  </li>
	<li>
		(Optional) <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/">Set Up SSH for Remote Connection</a>.
		With an SSH connection, you can log in to your Raspberry Pi remotely (from your regular computer). Youâ€™ll no longer need the HDMI monitor and USB mouse/keyboard connected to your Raspberry Pi.
	</li>
	<li>
		(Optional) Set Up Remote Code Editing with your preferred code editor, for example <a href="https://github.com/poemusica/rpi-matrix-gif/blob/master/UsingRsub.md">Sublime Text</a>.
		Alternatively, you can ignore this step altogether and just use Nano to write and edit code. Nano is a simple command line text editor that comes preinstalled on Raspberry Pi OS.
  </li>
</ol>    

### Assemble the HAT

Follow Adafruit's [great tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-plus-real-time-clock-hat-for-raspberry-pi/assembly)
on how to solder the components of the RGB Matrix HAT.

Donâ€™t be intimidated! This project was my first time soldering. I was able to do it, and you can do it too.

If youâ€™re new to soldering, see also Adafruitâ€™s [Guide to Excellent Soldering](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering).

### Activate the Matrix

Follow Adafruitâ€™s [instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-plus-real-time-clock-hat-for-raspberry-pi/driving-matrices)
for connecting the hardware, installing PIL (Python Image Library), and downloading/running their demo code.
    
When you have the Adafruit demos working, youâ€™re ready to start creating designs of your own!

## Display Pixel Art Animations


  1. Make a 32x32 pixel art animation using [Aesprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) (or some other software) and export it as a .gif.
    Youâ€™ll probably want to do this step on your regular computer.
    

  2. Copy your animated gif onto your Raspberry Pi.
     On your regular computer, open a new terminal and type:
    `scp <source> pi@<pi_ip>:<destination>`
    where `<source>` is the path to the file you want to copy, `<pi_ip>` is your Raspberry Piâ€™s IP address, and `<destination>` the path to this project directory on your Raspberry Pi.
    

  3. Run the displayGIF script to display your animation.
     On the Raspberry Pi or in your SSH terminal, type:
    `python displayGIF.py`
    By default, the script displays the included sample gif created by [@jettisonjoe](https://twitter.com/jettisonjoe). (Thanks Joe!) ![Ghost](https://github.com/poemusica/rpi-matrix-gif/blob/master/myGIF.gif)
    To display your own gif, simply replace `myGIF` in the code with the name of your gif.
    Use `Ctrl-C` in the command line to stop the script.
    

### (Optional) Run on boot

If you want the `displayGIF.py` script to run automatically whenever you start up the Raspberry Pi,
follow [these instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/rc-local.md)
to edit the `rc.local` file on your Raspberry Pi.
